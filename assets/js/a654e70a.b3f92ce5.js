The study tour, designed as an intensive summer law elective, sought\nto blend theoretical knowledge with practical legal insights, facilitating Juris Doctor students\nat UWA to earn credit units while gaining substantial international exposure. The five-day\ntour (December 4-7, 2023) involved interactive seminars led by a mix of academics and\npracticing legal professionals on selected areas of topical interest. Each session was designed\nto provide insights into the practical application and nuances of Singaporean law, contrasting\nwith Australian legal principles and practices. This outlines the educational strategy and\nobjectives behind UWA\u2019s short-term study tour and sets forth a detailed framework that other\nacademics might follow in developing similar programs."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},6114:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{y:()=>o});t(6540);var i=t(6696),r=t(9321),a=t(8759),s=t(4848);function o(e){let{sKey:n,children:t}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{children:i.FD[n].title}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:a.A.csContainer,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:a.A.csSessionNormal,children:t}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:a.A.csLearnButton,children:(0,s.jsx)(r.Px,{learnURL:i.FD[n].learnURL})})]})]})}},6696:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{FD:()=>a,q_:()=>i,xm:()=>r});const i=["A","B","C"],r="idNoSession",a={idNoSession:{title:"No session programmed",presenters:"",noAbstract:!0,learnURL:""},id1_A1:{title:"AI + Legal Education: a new 'Diamond Age' or a threat to rights and values?",presenters:"Rob Chalmers, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",learnURL:""},id1_A2:{title:"Enhancing Negotiation Skills in Legal Education: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence through a Chat Bot Approach",presenters:"Dr Tammy Johnson",learnURL:""},id1_A3:{title:"Building GenAI into Law Assessments: How do students use genAI when given the chance?",presenters:"Samantha Kontra, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",learnURL:""},id1_A4:{title:"Magic Defeat Magic? - An examination about AI plagiarism and the impact on legal education and research",presenters:"Qinqing Xu, Lecturer (Assistant Professor), University of Manchester, UK",learnURL:""},id1_B1:{title:"One Legal Future Post-Referendum: South Australia\u2019s First Nations Voice",presenters:"Dr Anna Olijnyk, Cornelia Koch, Madeleine Perrett",learnURL:""},id1_B2:{title:"Ngara: Embedding truth-telling about the legal system in the Sydney Law School curriculum",presenters:"Dr Fady Aoun, Associate Professor, Elisa Arcioni, Dr Louise Boon-Kuo, Louisa Di Bartolomeo, University of Sydney",learnURL:""},id1_B3:{title:"Embedding First Nations perspectives into the law curriculum, 'what do you do when it's all left up to you?'",presenters:"Dr Katie O'Bryan, Monash University",learnURL:""},id1_B4:{title:"'Zero tolerance to racism' - building law teachers' anti-racism capacities",presenters:"Jennifer Nielsen",learnURL:""},id1_C1:{title:"Are perpetual leases on M\u0101ori-owned land a basis for currently enforceable fiduciary obligations?",presenters:"Dara Dimitrov, University of Waikato",learnURL:""},id1_C2:{title:"No session",presenters:"",learnURL:""},id1_C3:{title:"Obligatory Activism?

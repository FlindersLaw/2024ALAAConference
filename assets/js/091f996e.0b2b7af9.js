This online book is a grass-roots\nresponse of legal educators around Australia to the growing demand for student\nlearning materials on the impact of climate change on the discipline and profession\nof law, and how law is itself changing in response to a climate-changed world. Most\nlegal educators\u2019 research expertise sits outside the field of 'climate law', and yet\nclimate change is increasingly relevant to all areas of the core law curriculum, as\nwell as many electives, due to the innovative uses of existing legal concepts,\ndoctrines, and rules to promote climate mitigation and adaptation. The panel brings\ntogether some editors and authors of the book to consider strategies for curricular\ninnovation which both satisfy the need for Priestley compliance and take seriously\nthe plasticity of law as an agent for change. The panel will discuss how legal\neducators can support the next generation of lawyers to practise as \u2018climate\nconscious\u2019 legal professionals with the relevant expertise and competencies to\ndeliver legal services and promote climate justice to a wide range of clients in a\nclimate transformed world."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,t.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},6114:(e,n,a)=>{a.d(n,{y:()=>o});a(6540);var t=a(6696),r=a(9321),i=a(8759),s=a(4848);function o(e){let{sKey:n,children:a}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{children:t.FD[n].title}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:i.A.csContainer,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csSessionNormal,children:a}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csLearnButton,children:(0,s.jsx)(r.Px,{learnURL:t.FD[n].learnURL})})]})]})}},6696:(e,n,a)=>{a.d(n,{FD:()=>i,q_:()=>t,xm:()=>r});const t=["A","B","C"],r="idNoSession",i={idNoSession:{title:"No session programmed",presenters:"",noAbstract:!0,learnURL:""},id1_A1:{title:"AI + Legal Education: a new 'Diamond Age' or a threat to rights and values?",presenters:"Rob Chalmers, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",learnURL:"https://padlet.com/ferr0182/alaa-2024-conference-mdjb79253jraj1xa/wish/2976374187"},id1_A2:{title:"Enhancing Negotiation Skills in Legal Education: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence through a Chat Bot Approach",presenters:"Dr Tammy Johnson",learnURL:"https://padlet.com/ferr0182/alaa-2024-conference-mdjb79253jraj1xa/wish/2976377735"},id1_A3:{title:"Building GenAI into Law Assessments: How do students use genAI when given the chance?",presenters:"Samantha Kontra, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",learnURL:"https://padlet.com/ferr0182/alaa-2024-conference-mdjb79253jraj1xa/wish/2976378176"},id1_A4:{title:"Magic Defeat Magic? -

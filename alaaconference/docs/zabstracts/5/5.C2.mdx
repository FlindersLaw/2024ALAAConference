## Abstract
When contracting parties fall victim to a Business Email Compromise (BEC) and a
subsequent Payment Redirection Fraud (PRF), the assignment of liability for
incurred losses can be contentious. Who should bear the burden: the party duped
into making the payment, or the party whose negligence facilitated the PRF scam?

Various factors influence liability, including the presence of insurance coverage and
the feasibility of reversing authorized push payments. In international transactions,
matters are more complex, and liability will also be affected by the applicable law of
the contract. Courts have often held the deceived payer accountable for the entire
loss, notwithstanding the negligence of the other party. Should the erroneous push
payment prove unrecoverable through banking channels, or in the absence of
insurance coverage, the victimized party may find itself compelled to remit payment
once more, this time to the correct account. PRFâ€™s are a real threat to consumers.
For example, Australians reportedly lost $16.2 million to payment redirection scams
in 2023.<sup>1</sup> PRFs also pose a serious threat to businesses, with the ACCC confirming
that in 2021 alone Australian businesses lost $227 million to PRFs.<sup>2</sup> BECs and PRFs
are also prevalent in other jurisdictions.<sup>3</sup>

The legal basis for determining where liability lies is however unclear, especially in
international transactions, and the international regulatory framework has many
gaps. The need for some international commensurability would introduce greater
certainty and potentially greater fairness in international transactions for businesses
and consumers.

## Abstract
The observation that regulation is decentred and pluralist is trite. There are many
initiatives undertaken by many actors to achieve compliance with regulatory goals,
such as mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Targeting and coordinating
regulation is an overwhelming task. Enter the concept of the regulatory space, which
is an analytical construct defined by a range of regulatory issues subject to public
decision. The regulatory space is occupied by actors and institutions in a relationship
of negotiated interdependence. The negotiation should be responsive but often
involves a ‘ferocious struggle for advantage’.

This presentation will explore and critique the construct of the regulatory space as
exemplified by particular conduct obligations owed by corporations under Australian
law. The formal actors include bodies such as ASIC and the strategies involve
mobilisation such as class actions.

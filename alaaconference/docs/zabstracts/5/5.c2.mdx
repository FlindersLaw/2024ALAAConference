## Abstract
The term “globalization” originated in the 20th century. Most researchers agree that
globalization as a concept has received increased attention since the 1990s; however, in
reality, the exchange of information and cross-fertilization between legal systems can be
traced back to much earlier. Initially, this term attracted the interest of researchers, principally
in the field of economics, as strengthening of the globalization process strongly influenced
many economic processes. Nevertheless, “globalization” as a unified term does not exist in
science. The literature suggests that globalization is understood as a twofold phenomenon. On
the one hand, it is an ongoing process; on the other hand, it is the result of this process. In this
regard, globalization cannot be understood as a complete result. Over time, globalization leads
to other economic, social, and legal changes. However, one must also consider that
globalization may, for various reasons, be constrained by state nationalism and insularity.

Some principal examples of globalization in civil law transactions are as follows:
1. Internationalization of economic relations and the consequent increase in the number of cross-border private legal transactions
2. Significant acceleration of the conclusion and performance (execution) of civil law transactions
3. Even greater need for standardization at the stage of civil law transactions’ conclusion
4. Scaling of civil law relations, as in general, the volume (number) of concluded transactions in the entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial spheres has increased significantly.

All of the above have influenced the development of civil law, for example, in the following
ways:
1. Unification of civil law: Internationalization of the economy required the convergence of legal regulations in different countries. Such unification or standardization takes place between the legal systems of groups of countries that have already established close economic relationships. The European Union and its supranational regulation of civil legal relations is an example of such groups of states, among which the process of unification has intensified considerably since the 1990s. Another example is the Commonwealth of Independent States and unification of the civil codes of its member states. Different unification approaches have been used.
2. New category of civil law transactions called “mass transactions”: One thesis of my research project and the topic that I would like to talk about is that globalization has also led to the emergence of a new category of transactions—mass transactions. Mass transactions have the following specific features:
    - At least one party concludes several mass transactions.
    - The terms of mass transactions are similar, if not identical.
    - Identity of the contractor and its personal characteristics do not matter for the party making mass transactions (key features).

Therefore, we refer to transactions “with everyone” (Rechtsgeschäfte mit Jedermann).
Examples of mass transactions include opening a bank account (§ 675f II German Civil Code,
art. 845 Civil Code RF), purchasing airline tickets, selling goods, and using public transport.
The specificity of mass transactions justifies the necessity of adapting law rules for the
conclusion of transactions.

The general civil law regulation for mass transactions has the following peculiarities:
- There is a need to ensure equal treatment (in technical and legal terms) of all participants willing to conclude a mass transaction.
- Equal and fair conditions for mass transactions must be ensured.
- The German and Russian legislation have developed common legal institutions, which aim to regulate mass transactions (§§ 305-310 German Civil Code, art. 426, 428 Civil Code RF).

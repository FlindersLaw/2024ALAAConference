## Abstract
Research suggests that the criminal trial (and broader legal system) replicate trauma
dynamics and contain many features that may act as triggers for trauma survivors. For court
participants who have experienced traumatic events (such as victims, defendants and other
witnesses), this creates a risk of re-traumatisation. The concept of trauma-informed practice
developed in the field of human services with the aim of guiding practices so that re-
traumatisation is minimised and no further harm is done. While a number of conceptual
frameworks for trauma-informed practice have been developed over the years, and many of
these have been applied to legal system contexts, existing frameworks have limitations. In
addition, a conceptual framework for application in the context of the criminal trial (and,
indeed, the legal system more broadly) has not yet been settled. This presentation discusses a
novel conceptual framework for the ‘trauma-informed trial’ that is tailored specifically to one
aspect of the legal system, the criminal trial, and aims to address limitations of existing
frameworks. The trauma-informed trial framework is intended to be used as a tool by law and
policy-makers, law reformers, academics, lawyers and others to assess the extent to which
existing criminal trial practices are trauma-informed and to inform development of trauma-
informed reforms to the trial. In this way, the re-traumatisation of court participants might be
minimised.

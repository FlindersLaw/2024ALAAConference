## Abstract
Catherine has a Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), majoring in English Literature, and Bachelor of
Laws (LLB), from the University of Adelaide. Catherine completed her Graduate Diploma in Legal
Practice at the University of South Australia.

Following almost 10 years in private practice, including representing the Australian Olympic
Committee in the lead up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Catherine moved to Norway to work
for Norwegian Olympic Committee, and then onto Qatar as Head of Doping Control for the 2006
Asian Games. Catherine returned to Australia to lead the legal team at the Australian Sports Anti-
Doping Authority (ASADA – now Sport Integrity Australia).

Recognising that her role at ASADA as Group Director Detection required a greater understanding of
intelligence and investigation techniques, Catherine completed a Graduate Diploma in Investigations
Management focused on inter-agency collaboration between anti-doping organisations and law
enforcement agencies at Charles Sturt University.

Catherine was invited to do sessional lecturing to sport management students at the University of
Canberra in 2012. This led to beginning a PhD by Publication in 2013, and a range of teaching
opportunities in law (at UNSW and The University of Melbourne) and in sport management (at La
Trobe University) at the Masters level. Catherine still lectures in “Sports Integrity and Investigations”
in the Master of Laws at The University of Melbourne.

Using an interdisciplinary approach, Catherine was conferred her Sports Management PhD,
“Protecting Sports Integrity: Sport corruption risk management strategies” from the University of
Canberra in 2019. Catherine is now Associate Professor (Sports Management) and Sport Integrity
Research Lead at the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport &amp; Exercise (UC-RISE) and
sits in the Discipline of Sport &amp; Exercise Science in the Faculty of Health at UC.

Catherine Ordway’s edited textbook *Restoring trust in sport: corruption cases and solutions*,
published by Routledge in 2021 took the “transdisciplinarity” approach advocated by Marjolaine
Viret: “where the emphasis is on policy-oriented work that involves practitioners and stakeholders of
the community in the process (as opposed to academic experts only)” (2019, p3). Viret looked at
applying interdisciplinary tools to improve anti-doping efforts (Viret, 2019), while Restoring Trust
more comprehensively situated doping within a broader framework of sports corruption. This
presentation proposes to promote the benefits and some of the challenges for legal academics
working collaboratively across disciplines and cultures.

The aim of *Restoring Trust* was to find best practice examples from around the world that different
sports and nations could learn from. Ambitiously, people who hadn’t written together before were
brought together to capture the excellent work being done that was not otherwise being presented
in regular conference programs. As editor, Ordway sourced, reviewed and edited 14 book chapters
contributed to by 24 authors from 10 countries, including (co)authoring 5 chapters herself. It is
hoped that this book demonstrates the benefits of transdisciplinary perspectives and ideas from
around the world, drawing on lessons from industries beyond sport.

With a keen eye on diversity, there are contributing authors from each of the continents, and a
proactive desire to promote early career researchers – particularly women – so there is a broad age
and experience range represented in the cohort. In the case studies chosen, the range of sports are
also varied. They include Olympic and non-Olympic sports, and sports at the professional and
amateur levels. There are summer and winter sports represented, team and individual sports, as
well as horse racing and the challenges faced in the multi-sport Major Games environment. The
types of corruption and the solutions recommended have also varied to provide ideas for readers to
apply in their own settings.

Featuring thirteen women and eleven men, the contributing authors from across the globe wrote
about sports as diverse as biathlon, sumo, rugby league, horse racing, road cycling, golf, tennis, ice
hockey and, of course, the world game, football. These sports are represented in case studies from
eight countries: South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Nigeria, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, New
Zealand and Australia. This is through the eyes of five professions: lawyers (11 of the 24 authors;
practitioners and/or academics), sports administrators, journalists, policymakers, and law
enforcement officers working together with academic scholars from nine broad disciplines: law
of course, but also business, criminology, economics, ethics, political science, psychology, sociology
and sports management. Truly inter-disciplinary with a world view!

It has certainly not without its challenges to bring authors with different languages, writing styles
and theoretical frameworks together. It was personally rewarding to learn so much from each of the
contributors. It is hoped that the goal orientated approach of writing word-limited chapters gave
the contributing authors the opportunity to both ‘introspectively’ consider the “positions and
implicit biases” of their own disciplines, and to ‘integrate’ a new, melded understanding into
practical, and ideally, unique, solutions (Viret 2019 p4-5).

The contributing authors were challenged to identify a case study(s) that most usefully
demonstrated the type of corruption chosen and the solution recommended. The brief then for
each of the chapter teams was to structure the case study along the lines of:
* What was the wrong-doing?
* How did that impact on trust?
* What was the response from the responsible authority/ sport organisation in attempting to ‘restore trust’?
* Did it go far enough? Are there other recommendations going forward?  

The brief to each chapter author(s) was to focus on a particular sport and a documented example of
corruption through a case study, to arrive at a unique solution for regaining trust.

This research has translated into both teaching and thought leadership through media and
commentary which has been enormously beneficial.

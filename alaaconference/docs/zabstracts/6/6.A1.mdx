## Abstract
In the 12 months since ChatGPT burst into the global consciousness, the promise (and threat)
of generative AI has animated mind in all professions and industries. For the judiciary, with
its reputation for conservative approaches to any reform, this technology can appear
particularly confronting. Yet the last decade has shown how effectively the judiciary can
respond to the opportunities of new technology, as highlighted by the rapid adoption of
technologies such as online hearings, public streaming, online public access to court files, and
electronic case management. In each case, the challenge has been to adapt the promise of the
technology to the purposes, principles and limits of the judicial role. This approach – of
reflective consideration of constraint and purpose – is going to be key to the judicial response
to generative AI.

This panel brings together scholars from a diverse range of legal disciplines to reflect upon
different aspects of what the advent of generative AI may mean for the judiciary in Australia.
This will include:
* Joe McIntyre (judicial theory and public law, UniSA) on the relationships between AI and the judicial function and the taxonomy of justice technology
* Anne Carter (public law, University of Adelaide) on the contemporary history of the use and abuse of generative AI in the courtroom
* Constance Lee (jurisprudence, UniSA) on the jurisprudential limits on the use of generative AI, and the inherent limits of the technology
* Lisa Parker (criminal law and legal education, UniSA) on the capacity of the current models of generative AI, and the need for judicial education.

Generative AI has transformative potential in the practice of the law and in assisting the
judiciary. However, it is likely that fundamental limits in the nature of the judicial role – and
in the technology itself – will operate as immutable constraints. This panel will explore both
this potential and the constraints, as well as the processes necessary to aid the transition to
this technology.

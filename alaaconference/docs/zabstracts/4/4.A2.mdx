## Abstract
The most critical challenge for legal academic scholarship originates in the future of
the Australian university education system. On 25 February 2024, the Minister for
Education, the Hon Jason Clare MP, released the Australian Universities Accord
Final Report (the Accord).<sup>1</sup> The Accord addresses ‘the knowledge, skills and
research our nation needs’<sup>2</sup> and without which Australia will not ‘prosper in the years
ahead’.<sup>3</sup> If the Accord delivers as envisaged, by 2050 55% of all Australians aged
between 25 and 34 will have a university degree (a 22% increase on present
numbers), and the Australian workforce will be appropriately skilled.

What does this mean for academics, including law academics, who have a weighty
burden of responsibility in realising the goals of the Accord? What may their
professional lives look like in 2050 and in the lead-up between now and then?
Chances are that in that time academics will still have a job, as the Accord
acknowledges that the number of academics ‘required to accommodate the needs of
an expanded higher education system’<sup>4</sup> will increase, although there is also no
certainty that the number of academic jobs will increase parallel to higher
enrolments. It is however highly likely that individual academics will teach a larger
number of students. The student population will have proportionately more students
from disadvantaged backgrounds and a greater range of international students from
a broader range of countries. Increased numbers of students may be in part-time
employment, and academics may need to ‘support more students who may need
extra help to succeed in their studies’.<sup>5</sup> Academics may also teach increasingly
online, or at regional universities, or at regional study hubs. Academics will likely
make extensive use of artificial intelligence. Academics and their competencies will
be heavily regulated.<sup>6</sup> They will be required to upskill themselves<sup>7</sup> and update their
teaching skills and the curriculum content to produce law graduates skilled in
technology, artificial intelligence and technology law. Law graduates would also
require additional competencies in climate law, first nations perspectives, social
justice and intercultural and interdisciplinary contexts. Apart from their importance in
teaching outputs, academics will also be key in delivering the exceptional research
envisaged by the Accord,<sup>8</sup> and in developing the talented future researchers and
innovators needed for a strong Australian future.<sup>9</sup>

The Accord is student-focussed.<sup>10</sup> The word ‘students’ appears more than 1,200
times. The word ‘academics’ 15 times, the word ‘lecturers’ once.<sup>11</sup> The future of the
students, however, depends largely on those academics who will teach them, train
them in research, and inspire them to be the ‘graduates with the creativity and
technical skills to meet future workforce and societal need’.<sup>12</sup>

In this paper I will propose that as a professional law academic, a wise course of
action now is to keep an eye on the future but a focus on the self. Faced with a
political blueprint for the future of Australian university education in the Accord, a law
academic may like to find and reinforce their personal professional identity as a law
academic, and allow the present and future of the academic profession to shape who
and what they are as academics now and in the future.<sup>13</sup> A strong actual or
aspirational professional identity helps navigate a professional career more
intentionally and hopefully successfully. In this paper, I will touch on what it means to
be a ‘professor’ – i.e. someone who professes publicly some expert knowledge – as
well as the modern-day realities of academia, including learning management
systems, a plethora of other software and systems, and university administration and
how these impact the law academic’s professional identity. By developing a strong
(but individual) professional identity (whether that is the ‘activist-lawyer’, the
‘reformist’, the ‘prac-ademic’, the ‘bureaucrat-academic’ or the ‘philosopher-lawyer’,
or anything else), professionals identities (including aspirational professional
identities) can assist in professional career development, and help navigate some of
the challenges of legal academia now and in the future.

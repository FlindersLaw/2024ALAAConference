## Abstract
The globalization of education has seen Australian universities not only increase their international
student enrollments, including the delivery of programs via transnational education (TNE). This often
includes the teaching of law units within non-law programs to students offshore at an overseas campus
of an Australian university or with a third-party provider via a TNE partnership or articulation model.
This paper explores the challenges of delivering introductory law units to non-law students in such
transnational context, through the lens of the experience of delivering introductory law units to non-
law students at James Cook University’s Singapore Campus.

Problems relating to the delivery of law units to non-law students have already been the subject of
other papers. One common challenge includes attempting to deliver materials that would typically be
taught across several semesters into a single 10-13 week period. Other difficulties include the non-law
students’ disinterest in the legal materials, and a possible lack of English proficiency. This paper sets
out several additional difficulties that compound these existing ones due to the nature of the TNE
delivery model. These include possible higher risks of plagiarism and crucially, the absence of local
context in relating to the legal materials being taught. These issues, when combined, poses difficulties
for both teacher and student alike.

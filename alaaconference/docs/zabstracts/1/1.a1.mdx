## Abstract
Social-scientific research in law aims to produce reliable knowledge about human behaviour and
social phenomena in the legal sphere (see Jasso 2004). Empirical research can contribute to this
enterprise by measuring or estimating real-world features or relations; and by testing theoretical
predictions or propositions. While empirical legal research has successfully yielded valuable insight
across jurisdictions and subject matters, it remains rare in the United Kingdom and Australia. This is
partially because empirical projects tend to be time-consuming and expensive to undertake. For
instance, many empirical projects need large data sets to obtain novel and reliable results.

Sydney Informatics Hub and I are developing a web-based program to reduce the cost of
doing empirical research involving judgments from British and Australian jurisdictions. Called the
Empirical Legal Research Kickstarter, this program seeks to make empirical research viable without a
large budget and an army of research assistants.

The Empirical Legal Research Kickstarter automates the two most expensive, time-
consuming and mundane tasks in empirical projects involving judgments: judgment collection and
description/summation. This program can automatically search for and download judgments. This
tool can also automatically produce common data formats with case-specific descriptions/features
obtained from judgment headnotes. For example, a spreadsheet with rows of judgments and columns
of catchwords/keywords, hearing dates, decision, decision date and so on. Moreover, building upon
efforts to utilise generative AI in empirical research (see generally Livermore, Herron and Rockmore
2024), our program can instruct GPT to do much of the work traditionally done by research assistants.
Only the utilisation of GPT will be (slightly) costly; all other uses of our program are free.

Pilot versions of the program are available at:

* (CTH) https://cth-empirical-legal-research.streamlit.app

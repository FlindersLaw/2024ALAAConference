## Abstract
This paper draws on a project carried out in the UK between 2020-21 which had the tripartite aims of: 

1. offering undergraduate Law students at the University of Liverpool opportunities for valuable clinical legal experiences in the immigration and anti-trafficking space; 
2. providing pro bono legal advice and representation to migrants without secure immigration status in the UK who had experienced trafficking; and 
3. researching the case work carried out by lawyers in order to pursue the rights of the clients, particularly strategies adopted to secure a right to reside within the UK. 

The research component involved analysis of the legal interactions between the solicitor acting on behalf of the clients and the Home Office, as well as other agencies, including support providers, legal practitioners and the Courts and Tribunals Service. This qualitative analysis of case files was situated within the context of the broader law and policy framework and findings of other researchers and stakeholders about access to legal advice and representation for victims and survivors of trafficking. 

The paper will, first, outline the specific social justice dynamics which shaped the project context in the UK: a legal aid system characterised by significant capacity issues and entrenched policies of financial cuts, and a highly politicised immigration system subject to ongoing proposals for restrictive reform. Secondly, it will explore whether ‘obligatory activism’ is a helpful frame for partnership between academics and practitioners who practice and research in areas of law and policy on the frontline of social justice and equity challenges. This will include analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of designing projects which pursue both clinical/educational and research-focussed objectives, particularly in legal areas with significant unmet need for legal advice. It will be demonstrated that, while collaborations can bring about in impactful and insightful outcomes, there are risks for the wellbeing and workload of the individuals involved, as well as potential for systems to become over-reliant on their goodwill.

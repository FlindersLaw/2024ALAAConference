## Abstract
Planned obsolescence in goods fuels the need for continued and increased production and depletion
of precious of resources. While having beneficial economic effects, planned obsolescence is
detrimental to consumers and does not advance the benefits of sustainability. Manufacturers are
using technology to come up with more sophisticated ways to reduce the life of products. For
example, built in software locks which prevent repairs by anyone other than authorised repairers or
software which effectively stops products from working on a pre-determined life expectancy date. 1
In June 2023 the European Parliament’s environment committee took a strong position 2  in the EU’s
proposed ecodesign regulation for sustainable products, supporting an EU-wide ban on planned
obsolescence. 3 New EU rules, introduced from March 2022 attempt to control planned obsolescence
and aim to make consumer products easier to repair, reuse and recycle, thereby reducing their
impact on the environment. This paper reviews the proposals and the existing EU rules on planned
obsolescence and considers how effective they will be at controlling the production processes of the
international manufacturing giants. The paper suggests that more needs to be done in the terms of
developing a UN treaty which could ultimately bind more countries in the quest to ban planned
obsolescence. The paper is written from a New Zealand perspective.

## Abstract
In this presentation we will provide an overview of the current laws regulating protest activity in Australia, and highlight the legislative trends towards increasing the scope and gravity of criminal offences aimed at certain forms civil disobedience and certain types of public speech (Moulds, 2023; McKay 2021).  This presentation will also touch upon the extent to which these legislative reforms interact with the implied freedom of political communication in the Australian Constitution, having regard to the High Court’s decision in Brown v Tasmania (2017) 261 CLR 328 and related cases.

The presentation will also discuss the role of the legal profession within this public discourse (Jacobowitz, 2021) – both as legal advisers to governments, not-for-profits and private entities, and as members of a profession that values individual human rights and rule of law.  We contend that the legal profession has an obligation to play an important conduit role between passionate citizens seeking to raise their voice in our democracy, and our elected law-makers tasked with balancing potentially competing public interests and rights.

## Abstract
This presentation explores the environmental law curriculum taught at tertiary level today and examines the viability of addressing new content into these courses. This  content is aimed at understanding application of the law to precautionary risk management  to address the world's most pressing environmental challenges. The aim is to revitalise environmental law teaching to meet a wider practical purpose. To understand the law is one thing but to apply it meaningfully to solve pressing environmental risks and challenges takes tertiary environmental law courses to another level. The presentation includes commentary on climate change adaptation, application of the precautionary principle and use of criteria and indicators of sustainability as part of a revitalized environmental law program.

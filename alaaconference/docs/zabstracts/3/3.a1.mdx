## Abstract
To what extent has technological change catapulted the doctrinal legal research
methodology into a new paradigm?<sup>1</sup> Has Artificial Intelligence affected legal research
skills required for a professional so that the whole method and way of doing has
changed - in the same way that the motorcar replaced horse drawn vehicles or
computers replaced typewriters or indeed the electric car is replacing petrol driven
engines? What other major international developments have affected legal research
skills and methodologies in the last decade?

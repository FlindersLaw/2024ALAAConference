## Abstract
In teaching law to law students alongside other legal academics, there may be
unconscious and unspoken premises accepted without conscious challenge: law
matters, law is known, law governs. In teaching law in an interdisciplinary team to
non-law students and to the broader national security community, those premises
can be ripped from under one’s feet like a proverbial intellectual rug. This raises the
question as to how to deliver legal content at the same time as laying the
foundations of the premises lawyers often accept as given. This becomes a matter of
teaching ‘legal ideas’ rather than rules and form.  Though this requires rethinking of
teaching structures and in some ways, a loss of sophistication in a legal sense, it
does enrich certain types of scholarship and education in three ways: socialisation,
contextualisation, and responsiveness. This paper considers both the unspoken
premises and how to teach them. In so doing, the author draws on her experience
learning to teach law to the national security community and what has been lost and
learned along the way.

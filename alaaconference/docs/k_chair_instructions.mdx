* Ensure PPTs are loaded for your CS:
  * All PPTs are in [**this share**](https://flinders.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ALAAConference2024Organizingcommittee/Eq2iRYPYbhJGnTW0btvoGsoBxPnCi6zW4uLKamrTyOYkFg?e=hU1hbH).
  * Go to the Folder for your CS and Stream (eg: 'Concurrent Session 1 Stream A')
  * The PPTs should be there in presentation order.
  * Each PPT is named with the session number and the presenter's name eg: *1.C1 Dara Dimitrov*.
  * Double-click on presentation. That will launch PowerPoint or Canva (depending on what presenter has chosen).
